This course is for you if you are a **data visualization practitioner** who falls in one of two categories:

1. You know the basics of data visualization but **are not yet well-versed in interactive data visualization on the web**
2. You know how to make interactive data visualization on the web **but are looking for a relief from existing tools, like D3 or React**

This course does not *require* much coding experience with the potential exception of intermediate JavaScript proficiency ([explained below](#knowledge-dependencies)).

### Youâ€™ll still benefit from this course if:

**You are an expert in D3.** This course will explain (and reiterate) how visualizations in Svelte require a different mental model from those built in D3. Adjusting to this new paradigm will take some time, but Iâ€™ll make the argument that visualizations built with Svelte are 1) more intuitive, 2) easier to debug, and 3) more readable than those made with D3.

**You know a bit of Svelte but not for data visualization.** This course will give leverage to the parts of Svelte that you already love â€” reactivity, data bindings, and state management â€” and introduce them in a visualization context. You will also learn the parts of Svelte that work great in visualization, which you might not have heard of (such as `tweened` values).

### Knowledge dependencies

In order to get the most out of this course, I would advise basic familiarity with [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), the de facto language for programming on the web. JS is near-universal on the websites you visit every day ([at least 98% of them](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cp-javascript)).

In particular, this course will rely on some key JS concepts which you would benefit most from learning, such as:

- Data types
- Array methods
- If/else statements and the ternary operator
- Functions, including arrow functions

As the course progresses and introduces new JavaScript terms, we will link to documentation and provide a callout box the first time you see something, like this:


:::note The `map()` method ðŸ’¡

The `map()` method **creates a new array** populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

In simpler terms, `map()` will run the same function or operation on each element in an array, and return a new transformed element

**Example**: `[1, 2, 3].map(d â‡’ d * 2) // returns [2, 4, 6]`

:::

Importantly, the callout boxes will provide information for these new concepts, but they will *not* document the more basic concepts such as the [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) (`=>`) used within `map`. This example in particular illustrates the baseline level of JavaScript knowledge you should have before beginning.

[This website](https://javascript.info/first-steps) serves as a good introduction to JavaScript, and can be a great reference if you encounter unknown topics throughout this course.

You do **not** need to know Svelte, or any other framework, and you do **not** need to know *anything* about D3. We will cover the important parts of D3 in this course (and purposely omit other parts of D3 â€” but more on that later).
