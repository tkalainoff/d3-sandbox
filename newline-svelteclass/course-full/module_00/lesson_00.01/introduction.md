## Welcome

Hey there, and welcome to **Better Data Visualizations with Svelte**! I’m Connor Rothschild, and I'm the instructor for this course.

I work at Moksha Data Studio, and I make data visualizations for newsrooms, government agencies, and nonprofits. I'm lucky enough to make charts for a living, and in the process of finding my footing in my career, I've learned a lot about the best ways to learn data visualization.

<!-- There’s one word I want to focus on: better.  -->
Whether you’ve never touched an interactive data visualization, or you make charts everyday, you probably agree; interactive data visualization has a steep learning curve.

In this course, we’ll learn how to use Svelte, a new JavaScript framework, to design data visualizations. Our new framework-based approach will make for a better authoring experience, better debugging, and better outputs.

You can expect to learn how to use Svelte to create powerful, engaging, and interactive data visualizations. In particular, you will learn the tips and tricks used in newsrooms and data visualization studios every day to create performant and powerful visual stories. Together, we’ll construct various chart types, from simple line charts, to complex geographic projections on globes. We’ll learn how newsrooms create engaging “scrollytelling articles,” and how we can leverage things like animation to bring our visuals to life.

At the end of this course, you’ll have a portfolio of professional visualizations that you can be proud of; that you built from scratch. But more importantly, you’ll have learned the tricks of the trade to make any visualization in Svelte.  

## Outline

This course is presented in four modules. After an introduction and environment setup in module 0, we will dive into module 1, where we will get a detailed introduction to your first Svelte app.

Then using the lessons we've learned from this in-depth module, we'll build more complex, interactive charts in Modules 2, 3, and 4.

### Module 0: Getting started
### Module 1: Your first Svelte chart: a simple scatterplot
### Module 2: A beeswarm plot using `d3-force`
### Module 3: An interactive world map & spinning globe
### Module 4: A NYT-style scrollytelling story
