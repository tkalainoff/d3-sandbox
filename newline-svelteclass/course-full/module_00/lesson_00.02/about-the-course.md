This course shows how Svelte makes for **better** and **easier** data visualization. Throughout the course, we'll build four charts together, ranging from simple scatterplots to complex and interactive maps. In doing so, you'll see the patterns used throughout the industry, which will prepare you to make **any chart** in Svelte.

## Prerequisites

You'll get the most out of this course if you have a basic understanding of JavaScript. If you're not, a sufficient primer is available [here](https://javascript.info/first-steps).

## What we won't do

This course will cover interactive data visualization on the web. It will not cover:
* Static data visualization
* Visualization theory (beyond what is practical to cover here)
