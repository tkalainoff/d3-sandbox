# This week's exercise

Awesome work getting through all of that tricky interaction code! During this week, add interactions to one of the custom charts you created in our previous exercises!

Choose whichever chart you are most excited about making interactive. Here are a few suggestions:

- tweak your line chart so that it draws a line to the y axis when you hover near a point
- tweak your scatter plot so that a circle turns into a square when you click on it
- add an info section next to your histogram that shows information about the last bar you clicked

**Now, go over the same steps we went through this week to add interactions to one of your custom charts.**

If you get stuck, watch this week's videos again or post a question inline or on the Discord channel. Good luck! We're rooting for you!

And once you're finished, show off your wonderful custom visualization on Twitter or on the Discord! We'd love to see it!
