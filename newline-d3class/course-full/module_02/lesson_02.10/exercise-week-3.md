# This week's exercise

Awesome work getting through our third week! During this week, make a totally new histogram! Here's our [list of fun datasets](/courses/fullstack-d3-masterclass/datasets), if you wanted to switch from last week.

Choose a dataset to play with -- you'll want to pick one with one metric whose distribution you're especially interested in. Here are a few suggestions:

- look at the distribution of number of unique colors in Bob Ross paintings
- look at the distribution of deaths in witch trials. Extra credit: make multiple histograms to see how this changed across centuries
- look at the distribution of penguin weight. Extra credit: make multiple histograms to compare weight distributions for different species

Fork our histogram CodeSandbox, download the data, and import it into your new forked sandbox.

A> If the data is a csv file, you'll need to use `d3.csv()` instead of `d3.json()`.

**Now, go over the same steps we went through this week to make a histogram with this new data.**

If you get stuck, watch this week's videos again or post a question inline or on the Discord channel. Good luck! We're rooting for you!

And once you're finished, show off your wonderful custom visualization on Twitter or on the Discord! We'd love to see it!
