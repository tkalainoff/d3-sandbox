# Radar Weather Chart

For this project, we'll build a more complex radar chart.

This chart will give the viewer a sense of overall weather for the whole year, and will highlight trends such as:

- What time of the year is cloudiest, and does that correlate with the coldest days?
- Do cloudy days have lower UV indices, or are they rainier?
- How does weather vary per season?

The complexity of this chart will increase the amount of time the viewer needs to wrap their head around it. But once the viewer understands it, they can answer more nuanced questions than a simpler chart.

We'll reinforce concepts we've already learned as well as new concepts, such as angular math, as we build this visualization. Let's get started!
