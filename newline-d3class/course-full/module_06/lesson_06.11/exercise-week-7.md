# This week's exercise

Awesome work getting through that crazy data visualization! During this week, create your own complex data visualization. This could be an extension of one of your previous exercises, or a totally new project.

If you're looking for inspiration, dig through our [list of fun datasets](/courses/fullstack-d3-masterclass/datasets). Make sure to choose a dataset that interests you - it'll be more fun if you're curious about the data itself. Or, you could make something new with our current weather data.

I'd recommend:

1. picking a dataset
2. familiarizing yourself with the data - what metrics are available, and what types of data are the?
3. brainstorm several ways to visualize these metrics - remember our dimensions in **Module 6**. I love doing this step with pen & paper, which feels really free.
4. fork or create a new Codesandbox and start going through our chart steps!

**Now, create your own complex data visualization.**

If you get stuck, watch this week's videos again or post a question inline or on the Discord channel. Good luck! We're rooting for you!

And once you're finished, show off your wonderful custom visualization on Twitter or on the Discord! We'd love to see it!
