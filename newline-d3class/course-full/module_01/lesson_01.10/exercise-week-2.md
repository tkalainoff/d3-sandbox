# This week's exercise

Awesome work getting through our second week! During this week, make a totally new scatter plot! Here's our [list of fun datasets](/courses/fullstack-d3-masterclass/datasets), if you wanted to switch from last week.

Choose a dataset to play with -- you'll want to pick one with multiple metrics that are numerical. Here are a few suggestions:

- compare the total number of colors Bob Ross used in his paintings to the number of unique colors
- compare the visibility of a lighthouse to its height or construction year
- compare the length of a penguin's bill to its depth. Extra credit: color each dot by the penguin's species

Fork our scatter plot CodeSandbox, download the data, and import it into your new forked sandbox.

A> If the data is a csv file, you'll need to use `d3.csv()` instead of `d3.json()`.

**Now, go over the same steps we went through this week to make a scatter plot with this new data.**

If you get stuck, watch this week's videos again or post a question inline or on the Discord channel. Good luck! We're rooting for you!

And once you're finished, show off your wonderful custom visualization on Twitter or on the Discord! We'd love to see it!
