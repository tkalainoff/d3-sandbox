# Steps in drawing any chart


In d3, there are general steps that we need to take every time we make a chart â€” we briefly went through each of them in **Chapter 1** to create our line chart, but now **let's create a checklist to give us a roadmap for future charts**.

1. **Access data**

   Look at the data structure and declare how to access the values we'll need

2. **Create chart dimensions**

   Declare the physical (i.e. pixels) chart parameters

3. **Draw canvas**

   Render the chart area and bounds element

4. **Create scales**

   Create scales for every data-to-physical attribute in our chart

5. **Draw data**

   Render your data elements

6. **Draw peripherals**

   Render your axes, labels, and legends

7. **Set up interactions**

   Initialize event listeners and create interaction behavior - we'll get to this step in Lesson 5
