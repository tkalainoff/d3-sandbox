**Amelia**:
[00:00:00]

So today we're talking to Shirley Wu, Shirley Wu is a freelance data viz designer.

I know you have your own special term for it that you made up.  If you can give us a little background on what you do, that'd be great.

**Shirley**:
[00:00:13]

 Yeah. So the title I made for myself, because I work for myself is. Independent. Oh, there's been evolution. So the latest evolution is independent data visualization designer and engineer.

Yeah. I feel like this is more just me being annoyed at people being like, what's your title? Because I don't know what my title is, but essentially what that means is I work with a variety of different clients, usually in tech and media and journalism. and I help tell visual stories with their data.

**Amelia**:
[00:00:48]

I love it. And I think it's such a new field that even if you have a shorter title, no, one's going to know what it means anyway. So I love that it's long and descriptive.

**Shirley**:
[00:00:59]

 I'm just like, this is exactly what I do for you.

**Amelia**:
[00:01:02]

It's just like reading a sentence. and I know you weren't always "this" job title. So if you could give like a little bit of background, like how you got started and how you got into this field, I think that'd be really helpful.

**Shirley**:
[00:01:19]

Yeah, of course. so when I first started, my career, I actually went to a big data company as a front end engineer, and that's kind of where I came across d3. And as I started kind of using d3 in my work, and then I started kind of going to the local Bay area, d3 meetups. That's when I was like, Oh, data visualization is a thing.

and this is a thing that I actually really enjoy. And so for my second job, I went to a startup and it was an enterprise security center, a startup, and I was... my official title there. So my first official title was, I think, Front End Engineer, I think, or Software Engineer. And I think my second official title was Member of Technical Staff, which is vague, but what I did for them is they wanted, essentially a visual tool to like help their customers kind of figure out how to secure their data center.

So instead of doing it by like tables or anything, they wanted a visualization that was kind of like part of their products. And so that's what I went and helped them build for a two and a half years. I think, as essentially I was a specialized Data Visualization Engineer, I guess, is probably the title now.

and then I think after that I wanted to go and try out things on my own, mainly because I realized I really enjoy data visualization, but not as much enterprise security. So then I wanted to kind of try freelancing to see what other sorts of companies were out there. What industries were starting to be in need of data visualization.

And that's how I started freelancing. And then you knew like people always ask you for titles and I'm like, I'm a freelancer and I make data visualizations and they're like, what does that mean? And I'm like, well, I design and I code. So that's, that's the title

**Amelia**:
[00:03:24]

Love it. I'm curious

when you were working at these companies, Oftentimes your developer or your designer... were you designing the data visualizations or were you getting designs and then implementing them?

**Shirley**:
[00:03:37]

Yeah. So, that's a really great question. So I think subconsciously that's probably. Like, you know, hindsight 20/20, that's probably one of the reasons why I wanted to venture off on my own, which is, even at my startup, which was quite like hierarchically, like vertically very fluid. And there wasn't that much structure and, you know, it had that sort of everybody does it kind of vibe, but even there, I was slotted as Software Engineer. And so like, fortunately I worked with people that were very much willing to take feedback. So the designer that I worked with, he was really great and took a lot of feedback. The product manager took a lot of feedback, but even then my role was software engineer, but I was like very much interested in kind of the whole process.

I was like very much interested in like the, customer feedback and like why the PM was thinking about certain features. I was very much interested in how those features were getting translates into designs and because I feel like by the time it gets to us as software engineers, there are a lot of decisions that have already been made.

And that's kind of hard to develop for without the original context. So it was because of that that I was like, and in my personal times, I had been doing all these data visualization projects. And for all of those, I get to do the whole process, right? Of going out and collecting my own data and doing my own design and doing the code.

So, I think not being able to be involved in the whole process in my full-time job, that was probably one of the things where it really drove me to be like, "Okay, I really want to try and go off on my own and see if I can do this whole process with like different clients."

**Amelia**:
[00:05:35]

I love that.

And that really resonates with me especially with data, you can't just like. Say, Oh, these are the requirements. Let's make a design and then hand it off to engineering because once you actually implement it, it might not be at all what the designs look like. You just really have to know what the data look like before you do the design.

And it's more of an iterative process where you need those tight feedback loops. And that can be really hard if you're sequestered, even in a small company, to this one part of the process.

How are things going doing freelance, where you kind of have all the control?

**Shirley**:
[00:06:13]

It's funny. Well, I actually wanted to say, I really enjoyed that part, in one of the talks that you gave, about kind of how you prototype and how you iterate, because like, that really is very much how very similar to how I work nowadays. And that's a really astute observation you made where I think my frustration was due to the fact that I couldn't do that iterative cycle within that environment. And I think that's really a product of 2014, 2015 data visualization of, I think it was so still so new, in  the business area that I think the conversation hadn't quite evolved to, "Oh, we actually need to involve the data visualization person much earlier in the conversation" to make sure that like what actually gets designed is very reflective of the data itself.

And I think that's a realization that we have now, and hopefully I'm hoping that it's something that's now much more implemented and much more commonplace in companies. That's my hope. I don't know if it really is, but yeah, I wanted to kind of,bounce off of that.

But yeah, for freelance now I really enjoy the whole being able to do the whole process. But I think at the very beginning, what I didn't realize was. how much, I didn't know. I was a sophomore engineer, very much trained as a software engineer and I'm like, "I want to take client projects." And it took me years to learn how much I did not know in terms of the design aspect, like the information design.

I think there was like a good year where I was like bumbling around just trying like different things and seeing what sticks from a design perspective. And I knew I made a lot of design, faux paus, for data viz. I'm actually really surprised that I don't get called out more often, like the bad like design decisions I made.

Then, you know, trying to kind of make up for that and then realizing that I'm really bad at the data side. I don't really know how to analyze it and trying to figure out a process for that. So it's been a lot of self studying, a lot of realizing what I was missing and self studying.

And I think there was a period of time at the beginning of the freelancing where, because I was trying to... you know, when you're a freelancer, you have to be like, "I'm the expert." Right? And so there was like a while where I was feeling major imposter syndrome, because I was like, okay, I'm an expert in like this one subset, and I'm trying to convince you to hire me for this whole process and I'm not an expert in these. So that's a... I don't know if that answers your original question...

**Amelia**:
[00:09:22]

I don't remember my original question, but that was really interesting. and I have so many follow-up questions, but I guess my main one is: do you think it would have been better for you to wait a little bit longer? Or, what are some things you could have done when you were working at a company to kind of solidify all of these areas, so that you'd feel more ready?

**Shirley**:
[00:09:46]

Mm, great question. So I don't think, waiting any longer back then, cause I went freelance in 2016, I don't think waning any longer back then would have helped because, I think again, it comes back to, there wasn't as much of a culture of including data visualization, like data visualization was an afterthought for a lot of companies back then. I don't know if that's so true now, but I don't think, even with kind of the openness of the startup I was at, I don't think, I think it would have taken me a very long time to get to the point where they would have, you know, let me be fully involved in the whole process.

And so I feel like going freelance let me get a crash course on the whole process where like it got crammed into like the space of a year to a year and a half. Whereas I think if I had kept on staying at a company, no matter which company, because companies just move a little bit slower, right?

Like, unless you're like a really nimble, like tiny little team, a company will always move much slower than an individual. And so I don't think I would have been able to get that crash course, and I think it would have taken me much longer to get that same education at a company. And I think, even though I was doing the whole process with my personal projects, back when I was full-time the very fact that I did not have to design the personal projects for any specific client, any specific stakeholder meant I was only like designing for myself and you know, when you're designing it for you, you're like, "I'll do whatever I want!" So it really was that having clients really taught me what I needed to learn.

**Amelia**:
[00:11:44]

Yeah, definitely. Especially since data visualization is about communication, right? You're communicating data. So having that feedback from someone is really nice because if it makes sense to you, you know, you've been working on it, you've been thinking about the data. Of course, that makes sense to you, but that doesn't necessarily mean... it's like built in user testing, which I think is really great.

I've done both client projects and personal projects. And I find client projects almost easier because you have this built-in feedback loop and you have these constraints to work in. I really like that.

 One other thing I wanted to ask you about is, when you have a new project you're working on, what is the process that you normally go through? Do you start coding right away or do you sketch a little bit? How do you approach new problems?

**Shirley**:
[00:12:35]

Ooh, I like this one.

Okay. So, So, yeah, so kind of, what I was mentioning earlier about how I've had to figure out the whole proces during my freelance time. I think I did a lot of that while working on a personal project called Data Sketches. It's a project with my really good friend Nadieh Bremer, who's an amazing data visualization... I don't know who her title, actually... she's also independent. So a data visualization person, creator/designer. It's a project where we chose 12 topics and we each did a visualization project for that for like 24 projects. And I think the most interesting part was that we required ourselves to do a writeup per project. And I think that really made me be able to introspect on my process. And so from that, what I learned is kind of, my process is very much like: first get the data, then go through and look at what each of the metadata is. And from there, start formulating some hypotheses, some interesting questions.

Then take those questions and then kind of use, I personally use Vega light as a very easy charting tool. And then I plug the data into Vega light, into different charts to kind of see if those questions have good answers. And when they do, when I kind of find that central message, that's when I start actually designing and sketching my ideas. And once I sketch, when I feel satisfied, I start coding it.

And of course, like once I code it, sometimes it turns out to be good and sometimes it doesn't, then I have to go back through the whole process and that's kind of the iterative  process that we've talked about before. And, the whole process I described is in the Data Sketches project and also, in the new Data Sketches book that we have coming out, in much more detail, if you're interested in any of that.

**Amelia**:
[00:14:57]

Yeah! I got some sneak peeks of a few chapters and you guys go into a ton of detail. I think I learned some new things. There's tons of really good tips and tricks as well as the overall process. So I think it's a really good book. Would recommend it! And I'm excited to check it out when it does come out!  Do you guys have a release date for it?

**Shirley**:
[00:15:19]

Oh, thank you! And thank you so much for all the feedback he gave us. He gave us so much great feedback. Okay. It is supposed to come out early February. I believe the exact date is February 9th, 2021, but please don't quote me on the date.

**Amelia**:
[00:15:34]

I can't wait. Well, thanks so much for coming on. It was really interesting talking about job titles and your process and your background. I think people are going to get a lot out of it.

**Shirley**:
[00:15:44]

Yeah, thank you so much for having me. This was really fun and I hope we get to do it again. Maybe you can have like a second course and then we'll do it like that.

Yeah. Or you can do a course and then I'll come on yours and we can trade off.
