# This week's exercise

Whew, awesome work getting through our first week! Before you start the next module, let's do an exercise to consolidate what we've learned so far. We'll do an exercise every week to build on our new skills and get practice working with unfamiliar datasets.

**During this week, make a totally new timeline!** I've put together a [list of fun datasets](/courses/fullstack-d3-masterclass/datasets).

**Choose a dataset to play with** -- you'll want to pick one with a metric that changes over time. Here are a few suggestions:

- look at how many colors Bob Ross used in his paintings over time
- look at how many opera performances there were for different composers, each year
- look at the height of newly constructed lighthouses over time

Fork our timeline CodeSandbox, download the data, and import it into your new forked sandbox.

A> If the data is a csv file, you'll need to use `d3.csv()` instead of `d3.json()`.

**Now, go over the same steps we went through this week to make a timeline with this new data.**

If you get stuck, watch this week's videos again or post a question inline or on the Discord channel. Good luck! We're rooting for you!

And once you're finished, **show off your wonderful custom visualization** on Twitter or on the Discord! We'd love to see it!
