# This week's exercise

Awesome work getting through all of those animations! During this week, add animated transitions to one of the custom charts you created in our previous exercises!

Choose whichever chart you are most excited about animating. Here are a few suggestions:

- animate the initialization of your scatter plot, making the dots fly in from the bottom, left on page load
- animate your line chart so that it floats up from the bottom on page load
- animate your histogram so the bars "bounce" every 10 seconds

**Now, go over the same steps we went through this week to add transitions to one of your custom charts.**

If you get stuck, watch this week's videos again or post a question inline or on the Discord channel. Good luck! We're rooting for you!

And once you're finished, show off your wonderful custom visualization on Twitter or on the Discord! We'd love to see it!
