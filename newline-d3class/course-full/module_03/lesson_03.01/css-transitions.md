# CSS transitions

Many of our chart changes can be transitioned with the CSS `transition` property. When we update a `<rect>` to have a fill of **red** instead of **blue**, we can specify that the color change take 10 seconds instead of being instantaneous. During those 10 seconds, the `<rect>` will continuously re-draw with intermediate colors on the way to **red**.

Let's try out an example! In our example, you'll see a blue box that moves and turns green on hover.

{width=75%}
![box transition](./public/images/4-animations-and-transitions/css-transition.png)

Let's open up the

`styles.css` file to take a look at what's going on. We can see our basic styles for the box.

```css
.box {
    background: cornflowerblue;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
}
```

And our styles that apply to our box when it is hovered (change the background color and move it 30 pixels to the right).

```css
.box:hover {
    background: yellowgreen;
    transform: translateX(30px);
}
```

To create CSS a transition, we need to specify how long we want the animation to take with the `transition-duration` property. The property value accepts **time CSS data types** — a number followed by either `s` (seconds) or `ms` (milliseconds).

Let's make our box changes animate over one second.

```css
.box {
    background: cornflowerblue;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    transition-duration: 1s;
}
```

Now when we hover over the box, we can see it slowly move to the right and turn green. Smooth!

{width=75%}
![box transition all](./public/images/4-animations-and-transitions/css-transition-all.png)

Now let's say that we only want to animate our box's movement, but we want the color change to happen instantaneously. This is possible by specifying the `transition-property` CSS property. By default, `transition-property` is set to `all`, which animates all transitions. Instead, let's override the default and specify a specific CSS property name (`transform`).

```css
.box {
    background: cornflowerblue;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    transition-duration: 1s;
    transition-property: transform;
}
```

Now our box instantly turns green, but still animates to the right.

{width=75%}
![box transition transform](./public/images/4-animations-and-transitions/css-transition-transform.png)

Instead of setting `transition-duration` and `transition-property` separately, we can use the shorthand property: `transition`. Shorthand CSS properties let you set multiple properties in one line. When we give `transition` a CSS property name and duration (separated by a space), we are setting both `transition-duration` and `transition-property`. Let's try it out.

```css
.box {
    background: cornflowerblue;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    transition: transform 1s;
}
```

`transition` will accept a third property (`transition-timing-function`) that sets the acceleration curve for the animation. The animation could be linear (the default), slow then fast (`ease-in`), in steps (`steps(6)`), or even a custom function (`cubic-bezier(0.1, 0.7, 1.0, 0.1)`), among other options. Let's see what `steps(6)` looks like — it should break the animation into 6 discrete steps.

```css
.box {
    background: cornflowerblue;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    transition: transform 1s steps(6);
}
```

What if we wanted to animate the color change, but finish turning green *while* our box is shifting to the right? `transition` will accept multiple transition statements, we just need to separate them by a comma. Let's add a transition for the `background` color.

```css
.box {
    background: cornflowerblue;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    transition: transform 1s steps(6),
                background 2s ease-out;
}
```

Nice! Now our box transitions by stepping to the right, while turning green over two seconds. Chrome's dev tools have a great way to visualize this transition. Press `esc` when looking at the **Elements** panel to bring up the bottom panel. In the bottom panel, we can open up the **Animations** tab.

A>If you don't see the **Animations** tab, click on the kebab menu on the left and select it from the dropdown options.

![animations panel](./public/images/4-animations-and-transitions/animation-panel.png)

Once we've triggered our box transition by hovering, we can inspect the animation.

![animations panel zoomed](./public/images/4-animations-and-transitions/animation-panel-zoomed.png)

We can see the `transform` transition on top, with six discrete changes, and the `background` animation on the bottom, easing gradually from one color to the next. The `background` transition diagram is twice as wide as the `transform` transition diagram, indicating that it takes twice as long.

This view can be very handy when inspecting, tweaking, and debugging transitions.

Now that we're comfortable with CSS `transition`, let's see how we might use it to animate our charts.

A>Not all properties can be animated. For example, how would you animate changing a label from **Humidity** to **Dew point**? However most properties can be animated, so feel free to operate under the assumption that a property can be animated until proven otherwise.
